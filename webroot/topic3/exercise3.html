        <h1>My Town</h1>
		
		<p class="p1">
			I live in the area close to hastings<br>
			It's very close to the sea and there is a stony beach<br>
		</p>
		
		<p class="p1">
			Its very quiet and not much happens in my town<br>
			the buildings aren't very tall
		</p>
		
		<p class="p1">
			Sometimes you can swim in the sea if<br>
			it is not too cold which it normally is
		</p>
		
		<p class="p2">
			There's lots of old people here<br>
			therefore it's often quite boring<br>
		</p>
		
		<p class="p2">
			It rains a lot just like anywhere in england<br>
			I've lived here all my life.
		</p>
		
		<p class="p2">
			I like my town because I have lots to do<br>
		</p>
